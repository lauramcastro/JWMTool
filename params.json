{"name":"JWMTool","body":"### What is JWMTool?\r\n**Java Watermarking Tool** (_JWMTool_) is a tool, developed in Java, meant to be useful to empirically evaluate limits of digital media (particularly, video) watermarking processes. This information is very important to design watermarking algorithms and techniques.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, _JWMTool_ supports uncompressed video ([YUV format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV)) and it can be used to perform tests where the component to be altered (Y channel or luminance, U channel or blue chrominance, V channel or red chrominance, or even a combination of these) can be selected by the user, as well as the coefficient range to be affected, the amount of variation to be inserted, the modification properties, etc. The process can be chosen to be blind or nonblind, too.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nThe repository includes a small set of JWMTool screenshots.\r\n\r\n### Video sources\r\nThe repository includes a few raw videos that can be used for tests.\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\n_Java Watermarking Tool_ has been developed to be useful in the first stages of watermarking-related research, developments or tests. Even though the latest version is just 0.6, it is fully functional and it can be freely downloaded and used, under [GPL license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL).
